## Description
Welcome to the AI Image Generator App! This app allows you to generate an image based on a description that you provide. The app uses the OpenAI API to generate the image, so you'll need to provide an API key to use it.

## How to Use

1. Go to the app's webpage.
2. In the text field, provide a description of the image you want to generate.
3. Select the size of the image you want to generate.
4. In the "API Key" field, provide an API key from OpenAI. You can get one at https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys
5. Click the "Generate Image" button.
6. Wait for the image to be generated. It may take a few seconds depending on the complexity of the image.
7. Once the image is generated, it will be displayed on the page.

## Tips

- Be as specific as possible in your description to get the best results.
- Try different sizes to see which one works best for your use case.
- If you're not happy with the generated image, try adjusting your description and generating it again.
- Make sure that you're using a valid API key from OpenAI. The app will not work without one.

## Troubleshooting

- If the image doesn't load, make sure that you've provided a valid API key and that you have a stable internet connection.
- If the image is not what you expected, make sure that you've provided a clear and specific description.
- If you're experiencing other issues, please contact support for assistance.
